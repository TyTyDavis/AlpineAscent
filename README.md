# AlpineAscent
A chill climbing platformer game built in Pico 8. The goal behind this project was to learn the basics of game design and coding for games. It was created in December of 2020, and as of December 2021 the game has a [small community of players](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=40791).

# Planned features
* Multiple characters
* More levels (using code rather than Pico 8's map editor to store them)
* Procedurally generated levels

# Bugs
* Players occassionally clip through walls while climbing
* Players can jump off of a wall without using stamina if they input the jump in a 1-frame window (this bug will be kept in the game at the request of the community)
